Write a crisp 2–3 min audio script from these story notes.

Rules:
- Start exactly with: "{Morning, afternoon, evening, etc}, it's {DATE}. Here's your Boston Briefing."
- Use 5–10 quick items, 4–5 sentences each.
- Attribute every item to its source ("According to WBUR, …").
- Only include facts present in the notes. No opinions or speculation.
- Prefer metro/city-wide significance; avoid tiny details or repeated stats.
- End with: "That's the Boston Briefing. Email Matt@Boston.com with feedback, Stay Classy, Boston"
