Write an engaging 2–3 minute Boston audio news script for today.

Rules:
- Greet the listener appropriately based on the current Boston time (morning, afternoon, or evening) and the date.
- Always lead with the most important and impactful news of the day. Sports should only lead if it is the single most important story.
- Include 5–8 stories total, each with 2–4 sentences, written in a natural, conversational tone for a professional public radio audience.
- Do not include any editorializing, sentiment, or sympathy (e.g., no “thoughts and prayers,” “we hope,” etc.).
- Integrate source attributions naturally into the flow — e.g., “The Globe reports…”, “Boston.com says…”, “B-Side notes…” — and vary the phrasing.
- Maintain a smooth narrative flow with light transitions so it feels like one continuous segment.
- End with a quick Boston-area weather forecast and any notable events happening later today.
- Close with: “That’s your Boston Briefing. Email Matt@Boston.com with feedback, and have a great day.”
- After the closing, append: “This is part of an internal beta. All stories were summarized by AI, the script was AI-written, and the voice is an AI recreation of Matt Karolian’s voice. Please do not share externally.”

Tone:
- Warm, professional, and conversational — think experienced public radio host.
- Vary sentence length for a natural spoken rhythm.
